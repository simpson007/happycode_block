Happycode Blocks brings together two different programming "grammars" that the Happycode Team has designed and continued to refine over the past decade. The standard [Happycode](https://happycode.mit.edu) grammar uses blocks that snap together vertically, much like LEGO bricks. For our [HappycodeJr](https://happycodejr.org) software, intended for younger children, we developed blocks that are labelled with icons rather than words, and snap together horizontally rather than vertically. We have found that the horizontal grammar is not only friendlier for beginning programmers but also better suited for devices with small screens.
